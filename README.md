# BresenhamAlgorithm
Side pet project to visualize the Bresenham Algorithm used to connect two points, displaying key metrics used in the algorithm's inner-workings

## Controls:
| Key | Use |
|-----|-----|
| W | Move second point up on the coordinate plane |
| A | Move second point left on the coordinate plane |
| S | Move second point down on the coordinate plane |
| D | Move second point right on the coordinate plane |
| E | Step forward through the algorithm |
| Q | Quit the program |
